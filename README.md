# QR Code Generation with Python

QR codes are a similar idea to barcodes, but extended in 2 dimensions. This allows them to hold a decent amount of data in a relatively small form factor. They are especially useful in modern times since both Apple and Google support QR code reading in their default camera apps for phones. People can quickly scan a QR code and process many types of data with reduced effort on their part.

Some of the main applications of QR codes:

- sharing text
- sharing URLs
- sharing Wifi login information
- sharing contact info
- sharing GPS coordinates

## Sharing Text and URLs

Text and URLs are pretty straightforward. You just pass in a unicode string and it gets converted into a QR code. Your QR code reader should automatically recognize URLs via the *https* at the beginning of the string.
